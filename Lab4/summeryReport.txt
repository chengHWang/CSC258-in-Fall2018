Part2 I forgot to use an register(dff), except this everything is correct.

Part3 is quite strange. I can't tell any difference from the codes and simulations
between my codes and Wen's codes. But my codes just don't work on chip! (Well, 
maybe it's just because I didn't find out how to operate this circuits in on the chip. 
Actually it's quite complicated.) But since the simulation is correct up to now, I can 
only take my Part3 codes "correct", cause I don't have chip to check it out. :(
